# Exam Grading Report

**Total Marks:** 36 / 52

## Summary Comments
The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the historical context, particularly in the short-answer and source-based sections. Questions 1 and 2(b) were answered perfectly, showing precise knowledge and application of historical skills. The longer responses for Questions 4 and 6 were well-structured and informative, reaching Level 3. However, the complete omission of Question 3 significantly lowered the overall score. Additionally, while the analysis in Question 2(a) was good, it could have been more detailed to reach the top level.

## Question Breakdown

### Question 1 (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies two valid features of crime in Whitechapel: crimes against authority (e.g., attacks on police) and crimes against the person (e.g., antisemitic attacks). Both features are supported with relevant examples, meeting the criteria for full marks.

**Citations:**
- *"One feature can be that they were crimes against authority... consistent attacks on the police"* (student_answer)
- *"Award 1 mark for each valid feature identified up to a maximum of two features. The second mark should be awarded for supporting information."* (marking_schema)

### Question 2(a) (5/8 marks)

**Reasoning:** This is a Level 2 response. The student provides judgements on the utility of both sources based on their content (overcrowding, violence) and provenance (class bias, publication type). While the analysis of provenance is somewhat generic, it is correctly linked to the sources' usefulness for the enquiry.

**Citations:**
- *"Source A is useful... as they describe the inhabitable and concerning aspects... overcrowding in places such as the kitchen and bedroom"* (student_answer)
- *"Judgements on source utility for the specified enquiry are given, using valid criteria. Judgements are supported by developed comment related to the content of the sources and/or their provenance."* (marking_schema)

---

### Question 2(b) (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student successfully completes all four components of the follow-up task: selecting a valid detail from Source A, framing a relevant historical question, identifying a suitable source (Census), and explaining how that source would help answer the question.

**Citations:**
- *"Detail in Source A that I would follow up: 'In the kitchen, about twenty men and women were sitting or standing round the fire'"* (student_answer)
- *"Award 1 mark for selecting a detail in Source A that could form the basis of a follow-up enquiry"* (marking_schema)

### Question 3 (0/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student did not provide an answer for this question.

### Question 4 (9/12 marks)

**Reasoning:** This response reaches Level 3. The student provides a clear explanation for the changes in transportation, covering the initial use in North America, the shift to Australia following American Independence, and the impact of the gold rush on the cessation of the practice. It addresses three distinct aspects of content.

**Citations:**
- *"English courts decided to transport convicts to North America during 1610 - 1770... Secondly, the rate of transportation to America had closed due to American Independence of 1783"* (student_answer)
- *"Accurate and relevant information is included, showing good knowledge and understanding of the required features or characteristics of the period studied."* (marking_schema)

---

### Question 6 (14/20 marks)

**Reasoning:** The essay is awarded 11 marks for AO1/AO2 (Level 3) and 3 marks for SPaG (Intermediate). The student provides a structured explanation of changes in policing, including public relations, technology (vehicles), and the CID. Although the student's use of 'disagree' is linguistically confusing, the content clearly supports the argument for significant change with relevant historical detail.

**Citations:**
- *"the introduction of a Criminal Investigation Department (CID), allowed for the creation of the first Detective Department for policing."* (student_answer)
- *"Accurate and relevant information is included, showing good knowledge and understanding of the required features or characteristics of the period studied."* (marking_schema)
