# Exam Grading Report

**Total Marks:** 42 / 52

## Summary Comments
The student demonstrates a high level of historical knowledge and understanding across all sections of the paper. They are particularly strong at identifying key features and explaining changes over time, as seen in the excellent responses on witchcraft and transportation. The use of specific dates and legislative acts (e.g., the 1736 Witchcraft Act, the 1878/79 CID) adds significant weight to their arguments. In the source-based questions, the student successfully extracts information and makes valid comments on provenance, although the evaluation of source utility could be further enhanced by integrating more specific contextual knowledge. The final essay on policing is well-structured and addresses multiple aspects of change, supported by a high standard of spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

## Question Breakdown

### Question 1 (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies two features of crime in Whitechapel (crimes against authority and crimes against the person) and provides relevant supporting information for each, such as attacks on police and antisemitic attacks.

**Citations:**
- *"One feature can be that they were crimes against authority... An example of this can be consistent attacks on the police"* (student_answer)
- *"Award 1 mark for each valid feature identified up to a maximum of two features. The second mark should be awarded for supporting information."* (marking_schema)

### Question 2(a) (5/8 marks)

**Reasoning:** The answer reaches the top of Level 2. It provides judgements on utility based on content and provenance. It mentions the upper-class perspective of Source A and the nature of Source B as a magazine illustration. However, the contextual knowledge is somewhat limited and not deeply integrated into the evaluation, preventing a higher mark in Level 3.

**Citations:**
- *"Source A is useful... as they describe the inhabitable and concerning aspects... for example, the accounting of overcrowding"* (student_answer)
- *"Judgements on source utility for the specified enquiry are given, using valid criteria. Judgements are supported by developed comment related to the content of the sources and/or their provenance."* (marking_schema)

### Question 2(b) (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** Full marks awarded. The student selects a valid detail from Source A regarding the number of people in the kitchen, asks a relevant follow-up question about average occupancy, identifies an appropriate source (Census), and explains how it would help calculate averages over time.

**Citations:**
- *"Detail in Source A that I would follow up: 'In the kitchen, about twenty men and women were sitting or standing round the fire'"* (student_answer)
- *"Award 1 mark for identification of an appropriate source to use in a follow-up enquiry and 1 mark for an answer that explains how the information it contains could help answer the chosen follow-up question."* (marking_schema)

---

### Question 3 (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student clearly explains the difference in treatment, noting the shift from capital punishment (c1500-1700) to the 1736 Act which treated it as fraud (c1700-1900). This shows good knowledge and analysis of the difference.

**Citations:**
- *"during the 1500-1700 period, witchcraft was considered a capital punishment... However, this changed during the 1700-1900 period, as the 1736 Witchcraft Act decriminalised the crime"* (student_answer)
- *"Features of the period are analysed to explain a difference. [AO2] Specific information about the topic is added to support the comparison, showing good knowledge and understanding of the periods. [AO1]"* (marking_schema)

---

### Question 4 (10/12 marks)

**Reasoning:** The answer is placed in Level 4. It provides a well-structured explanation covering three key aspects: the initial need for labor in North America, the impact of American Independence leading to the shift to Australia, and the effect of the Gold Rush. The reasoning is coherent and supported by accurate dates and facts.

**Citations:**
- *"English courts decided to transport convicts to North America during 1610-1770... the rate of transportation to America had closed due to American Independence of 1783... the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851"* (student_answer)
- *"An analytical explanation is given which is directed consistently at the conceptual focus of the question, showing a line of reasoning that is coherent, sustained and logically structured. [AO2]"* (marking_schema)

---

### Question 6 (15/20 marks)

**Reasoning:** The response is awarded 11 marks for content (Level 3) and 4 marks for SPaG (High). It addresses three aspects: the introduction of the CID/forensics, changes in public relations, and the impact of technology (vehicles). The analysis is good, and the knowledge of specific developments like the CID is accurate. SPaG is excellent with consistent accuracy and good use of specialist terminology.

**Citations:**
- *"the introduction of the CID in 1879... allowed for police work to be significantly easier as detectives would be able to figure who committed what"* (student_answer)
- *"Accurate and relevant information is included, showing good knowledge and understanding of the required features or characteristics of the period studied. [AO1]"* (marking_schema)
