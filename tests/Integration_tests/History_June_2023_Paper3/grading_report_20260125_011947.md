# Exam Grading Report

**Total Marks:** 40 / 52

## Summary Comments
The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the period, particularly regarding the causes of the NEP and the start of the purges. Inferences are well-supported, and the evaluation of interpretations is generally sustained. To improve, the student should ensure historical dates are accurate (e.g., the Kronstadt Mutiny relevant to the NEP was in 1921, not 1917) and use more precise contextual details to support evaluations.
