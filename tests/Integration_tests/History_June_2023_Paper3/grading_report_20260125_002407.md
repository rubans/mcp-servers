# Exam Grading Report

**Total Marks:** 42 / 52

## Summary Comments
The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the period and the specific requirements of the source-based and interpretation-based questions. Strengths include clear identification of differences between interpretations and the ability to evaluate source utility using provenance. Weaknesses include some chronological inaccuracies, such as misdating the Kronstadt Mutiny to 1917, and occasional lapses in the precision of historical detail, which prevented the student from achieving the highest marks in the longer explanatory and evaluative questions.

## Question Breakdown

### Question 1 (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student has provided two valid inferences supported by relevant details from the source. The first inference correctly identifies the aim to challenge the Provisional Government, and the second correctly identifies the aim to introduce a Constituent Assembly.

### Question 2 (8/12 marks)

**Reasoning:** The answer fits Level 3. It provides an explanation with some analysis directed at the conceptual focus (causation). It shows good knowledge of War Communism and the Tambov rebellion ('tenber rebellion'). The student goes beyond the stimulus points by including the peasant revolts in the countryside.

### Question 3(a) (6/8 marks)

**Reasoning:** The answer meets Level 3 criteria. It provides judgements on utility using valid criteria, including developed reasoning about provenance (Bukharin's private conversation, Kravchenko's role as an official). The student uses contextual knowledge (Ryutin Affair) to evaluate the sources.

- *""* (unknown)

### Question 3(b) (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies and supports the key difference: Interpretation 1 focuses on Stalin's personality and long-term ambition, while Interpretation 2 focuses on the murder of Kirov as the immediate trigger.

**Citations:**
- *""* (unknown)
- *""* (unknown)

---

### Question 3(c) (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student provides a valid explanation for the difference by identifying that the interpretations rely on different sources (Source B for Interpretation 1 and Source C for Interpretation 2). This is a recognized approach in the mark scheme.

**Citations:**
- *""* (unknown)
- *""* (unknown)

---

### Question 3(d) (16/20 marks)

**Reasoning:** The answer provides an explained evaluation reviewing alternative views and reaching a substantiated judgement, placing it in Level 4 (13 marks for content). It uses both interpretations and relevant contextual knowledge (e.g., agitprop, old Bolsheviks). The reasoning is coherent and sustained. For SPaG, the student receives 3 marks (Intermediate) as they spell and punctuate with considerable accuracy and use a good range of specialist terms, despite some minor errors ('agitpop', 'tenber').
