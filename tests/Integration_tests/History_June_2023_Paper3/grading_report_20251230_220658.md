# Exam Grading Report

**Total Marks:** 46 / 52

## Summary Comments
The candidate has produced a very strong script, demonstrating a clear grasp of the historical period and the required exam skills. In Section A, the inferences are precise and the explanation of the NEP is well-developed, showing knowledge beyond the stimulus points despite a minor chronological error regarding the Kronstadt Mutiny. In Section B, the evaluation of source utility is sophisticated, and the analysis of interpretations is excellent. The final essay on the causes of the purges is particularly well-argued, with a justified conclusion that weighs the provided interpretations against the scale of historical events. SPaG is of a high standard throughout.

## Question Breakdown

### Question 1 (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student correctly identifies two valid inferences from Source A regarding the aims of the Kornilov Revolt: the desire to remove the Provisional Government and the plan to establish a Constituent Assembly. Both inferences are supported with appropriate details from the text.

**Citations:**
- *"Together, the Germans and the Government are killing our country"* (student_answer)
- *"To challenge the Provisional Government (1). ‘Together the Germans and the Government are killing our country...’ (1)."* (marking_schema)

### Question 2 (9/12 marks)

**Reasoning:** The explanation for the introduction of the NEP is strong, covering the failures of War Communism and the impact of the Kronstadt Mutiny. The student successfully goes beyond the stimulus points by detailing the Tambov Rebellion. The answer is analytical and generally well-structured. A mark was deducted because the student incorrectly dated the Kronstadt Mutiny to 1917 instead of 1921, which is a significant factual error in an otherwise high-level response.

**Citations:**
- *"the tambov rebellion, happening in the tambov province, was a peasant revolt"* (student_answer)
- *"The Bolsheviks needed to avoid further peasant uprisings, like that in Tambov, which occurred as a result of the policy of War Communism."* (marking_schema)

### Question 3(a) (7/8 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student provides a high-level evaluation of the utility of both sources. They correctly identify the value of Bukharin's private thoughts in Source B and Kravchenko's insider perspective in Source C. The answer uses relevant contextual knowledge, such as the Ryutin Affair, to critique the sources' limitations. It meets the criteria for Level 3.

**Citations:**
- *"Source B is useful... as it takes in account, a fellow official of Stalin & Lenin and their thoughts"* (student_answer)
- *"Judgements on source utility for the specified enquiry are given, applying valid criteria with developed reasoning which takes into account how the provenance affects the usefulness of the source content."* (marking_schema)

---

### Question 3(b) (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student accurately identifies the fundamental difference between the two interpretations: Interpretation 1 focuses on Stalin's personality and long-term ambition, while Interpretation 2 identifies the murder of Kirov as the specific trigger. The difference is well-supported with evidence from both texts.

**Citations:**
- *"Interp 1 talks about how his personality & impression caused him to the beginning of the purges, whereas in Interpretation 2, they believe Kirov's murder was the start"* (student_answer)

---

### Question 3(c) (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student offers a valid reason for the difference in interpretations, suggesting that the authors gave different weight to different sources. This is effectively substantiated by linking Interpretation 1 to the focus on personality in Source B and Interpretation 2 to the focus on Kirov's murder in Source C.

**Citations:**
- *"One reason why Interp 1 and 2 give different views... is Interp 1 heavily bases the main factor... on his personality... which can be linked to Source B"* (student_answer)
- *"The interpretations may differ because they have given weight to different sources."* (marking_schema)

---

### Question 3(d) (14/16 marks)

**Reasoning:** This is a sophisticated response that evaluates both interpretations using precisely selected contextual knowledge. The student discusses the role of 'agitprop' and the scale of arrests in Leningrad. The final judgement is particularly strong, arguing that while personality played a role, a major event like Kirov's murder is a more plausible explanation for the mass scale of the purges. It sits comfortably in Level 4.

**Citations:**
- *"one man's personality can't have been the change for 40,000 people"* (student_answer)
- *"The murder led to thousands of Communist party members being arrested. In Leningrad alone, 40 000 were arrested."* (marking_schema)

---

### Question SPaG (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The student's writing is consistently accurate in terms of spelling, punctuation, and grammar. They use a wide range of specialist historical terms (e.g., 'agitprop', 'autocratic', 'Old Bolsheviks') correctly and effectively.

**Citations:**
- *"Learners spell and punctuate with consistent accuracy. Learners use rules of grammar with effective control of meaning overall. Learners use a wide range of specialist terms as appropriate."* (marking_schema)
