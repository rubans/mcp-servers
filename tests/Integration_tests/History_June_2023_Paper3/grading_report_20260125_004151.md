# Exam Grading Report

**Total Marks:** 42 / 52

## Summary Comments
The candidate demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter, particularly in the analysis of historical interpretations and source utility. The response to the NEP introduction shows good use of 'own knowledge' (Tambov), though a significant chronological error regarding the Kronstadt Mutiny (dating it to 1917 instead of 1921) prevented a higher mark in that section. The evaluation of the purges is sophisticated, effectively weighing long-term personality factors against short-term triggers.

## Question Breakdown

### Question 1 (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The candidate has provided two valid inferences supported by direct quotes from the source. The first inference regarding the removal of the Provisional Government is correctly linked to the quote about the government 'killing our country'. The second inference regarding the establishment of an assembly is correctly linked to the promise of a Constituent Assembly.

### Question 2 (8/12 marks)

**Reasoning:** The answer provides a good explanation of the introduction of the NEP, covering War Communism and peasant uprisings (Tambov/Tenber). It goes beyond the stimulus points by including the Tambov rebellion. However, the section on the Kronstadt Mutiny contains a significant chronological error, dating it to 1917 and linking it to the initial revolution rather than the 1921 mutiny against Bolshevik rule. This inaccuracy prevents the answer from reaching Level 4.

### Question 3(a) (6/8 marks)

**Reasoning:** The candidate provides a Level 3 response. They evaluate the utility of both sources by looking at content and provenance. They correctly identify Bukharin's position and the private nature of the conversation in Source B. For Source C, they identify Kravchenko's role and link the content to the escalation of the purges. Contextual knowledge (Ryutin Affair, NKVD) is used to assess the limitations of the sources.

### Question 3(b) (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The candidate correctly identifies the key difference: Interpretation 1 focuses on Stalin's personality and long-term ambition, while Interpretation 2 focuses on the murder of Kirov as the specific trigger. Both views are supported with details from the text.

### Question 3(c) (4/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The candidate provides a valid explanation for the difference by suggesting the authors relied on different sources. They effectively link Interpretation 1 to Source B (personality) and Interpretation 2 to Source C (Kirov's murder).

**Citations:**
- *""* (unknown)
- *""* (unknown)

---

### Question 3(d) (13/16 marks)

**Reasoning:** The candidate provides a Level 4 response. They offer a sustained and coherent evaluation of Interpretation 2, comparing it against Interpretation 1. They use precise contextual knowledge (agitprop, politburo, 40,000 arrests) to support their analysis. The judgement is substantiated, arguing that while personality was a factor, a specific 'spark' like Kirov's murder is a more plausible explanation for the scale of the purges.

**Citations:**
- *""* (unknown)
- *""* (unknown)

---

### Question SPaG (3/4 marks)

**Reasoning:** The candidate writes with considerable accuracy. They use a good range of specialist terms (agitprop, politburo, proletariat, old bolshevik). There are some minor spelling errors ('bergoise', 'tenber', 'insticted'), but they do not hinder meaning.

**Citations:**
- *""* (unknown)
- *""* (unknown)
