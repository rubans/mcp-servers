The response to the NEP introduction shows good use of 'own knowledge' (Tambov), though a significant chronological error regarding the Kronstadt Mutiny (dating it to 1917 instead of 1921) prevented a higher mark in that section. The evaluation of the purges is sophisticated, effectively weighing long-term personality factors against short-term triggers.",

      "student_transcript": "One reason why the NEP (New Economic Policy) was introduced in 1921 was heavily based on the cruel and harsh objectives set by the Bolsheviks, during the civil war period (e.g. 1918-1921) by War Communism. For example, War Communism was the first try by the Bolsheviks, to set up a centralised economic policy, with aims of requisitioning & taking by force of the crops, in order to supply the red army in the civil war. Furthermore, Lenin foresaw the brutality of War Communism & its past effects on Russia, hence why Lenin introduced the NEP, to increase the economy of Russia to level that it was, during Tsar Nicholas II's reign of Russia. Another reason why the NEP was introduced in 1921 was due to the Kronstadt Mutiny in 1917 and its past effects to what later be named as the Russian Revolution. For example, the Kronstadt mutiny was established in 1917 due to the political unrest that was occuring in Russia, during this period and for first time, sailors refused to listen to the officers and instead decided to execute officers & captains as they were accused of acting like the bergoise of Russia. As a result, this would lead to soldiers on land, refusing orders and join in the revolution of Russia, asking for more rights & equality between all the classes and the establishment of the NEP in 1921, to restore the political aspect of Russia without orchestrating another revolt or war to the detriment of the population. Finally, Another Reason why the NEP was introduced in 1921 was because of the public discontent in the countryside during 1921. For Example, the tenber rebellion, happening in the tenber province, was a peasant revolt, orchestrated by the peasants, on the Red Guard requisition of their crops & repression they faced. Furthermore, with this rebellion, more revolts occurred in the countryside mainly due to the harsh treatment the peasants faced during the Civil War for their food supply, so Lenin introduced the NEP as a kinder alternative to the peasants. As a result, instead of being requisitioned for their food, they were taxed and were allowed to keep a surplus of the food, gaining the support of the peasants and establishing a level of social impact on Russia.",

      "reasoning": "The answer provides a good explanation of the introduction of the NEP, covering War Communism and peasant uprisings (Tambov/Tenber). It goes beyond the stimulus points by including the Tambov rebellion. However, the section on the Kronstadt Mutiny contains a significant chronological error, dating it to 1917 and linking it to the initial revolution rather than the 1921 mutiny against Bolshevik rule. This inaccuracy prevents the answer from reaching Level 4.",

      "student_transcript": "Source B is useful for an enquiry into the main reason why Stalin's purges began as it takes into account, a fellow official of Stalin & Lenin and their thoughts of the current leader (e.g Stalin). For example, Bukharin, the fellow official of Stalin, recounts his thoughts of Stalin & the overall impression that he gives to others, to a Russian living in exile. As a result, most of the information in Source B is mostly to Stalin's brutal and horrifying nature, which can be linked to how he ordered his way of violent repression (e.g purges). The limitations can be that they can be biased, intended to denigrate the reputation of Stalin, not referencing positive aspects of Stalin. In addition, Source C is useful for an enquiry into how Stalin's purges began as Source C mentions how Kirov's assassination led to Stalin repressing and removing opponents to the party, who were considered threats to him. For example, Victor Kravchenko, a russian official of the communist party, recounts how Kirov's killer, Nicolayev was working with foreign countries to remove Stalin, showing how this was an international plan to save Russia. Furthermore, many other members of the Bolsheviks & political opponents were also linked with Nicolayev, suggesting that everyone wanted to remove Stalin with immediate effect. As a result, this led to Stalin's paranoia increasing, eventually leading him to start purging enemies of him, to establish an autocratic dictatorship. However, the account only states about the aftermath of Kirov's murder and not other events, such as the Ryutin Affair and the OGPU and the NKVD.",

      "student_transcript": "I strongly agree with Interpretation 2 about the main reason why Stalin's purges began was the murder of Kirov was the spark in the unravelling of a violent, repressive regime, instigated by Stalin, to remove possible opponents & threats to his dictatorship of the people & proletariat of Russia. For example, the murder of Kirov was used as a violent warning by Stalin, in the form of propaganda, created by the agitprop, to show the public that politicians are for the cause of Kirov's death and that they did this to overthrow the party. As a result of this, Stalin began to be paranoid & suspicious of the members of his party and believed that they were planning to remove him and the party from existence, thus starting the purges, to tighten the control of the country & remove threats to his regime. On the other hand, some would disagree with Interpretation 2, as being the main reason to why Stalin's purges began as others may say that it was Stalin's personality & impression, that led to the purges of 1936-1938. For example, in interpretation 1, the author proclaims that Stalin's self obsession was the key main factor for the start of purges. Furthermore, the use of his self-obsession can lead to someone becoming paranoid and jealous of others, who held higher positions than him (e.g Lenin, Trotsky etc.). Therefore, with this jealousy and paranoia, he decided to purge members that were close to these people, in order to establish an autocratic, formidable regime, which no one of Russia, could stop. In addition, I would strongly agree that Interpretation 1 played a key role in terms of why Stalin's purges began because the use of personality & impression played a key role into why he wanted to be better than everyone. For example, In Interpretation 1, it is suggested by the account, that he believed he was a genius, who would play a key and unique historical role in the transformation of Russia. However, his urge to be better than everyone but also prove to them was inevitable as everyone saw Lenin as the saviour of Russia but saw Stalin as someone jealous and paranoid of being second to Lenin. Furthermore, it was shown through Stalin, as someone who is power hungry and would do anything to grip power and control (e.g dissolving the old bolshevik party and establishing his own party). Conversely, I would disagree that Interpretation 1 was the main factor but rather Interpretation 2 because personally, one man's personality can't have been the change for 40,000 people as it looks too vague and unusual. However, the use of a key event such as the assassination of Kirov can be believable as Kirov was one of key leading figures in the party and established his position as someone, who was a great speaker and politician for the people of Russia. In addition, this was someone, who was very close to Stalin and if he was murdered, the consequences of this atrocity would be great & massive to the detriment of the politburo as Stalin saw this event as a plot to overthrow the party, so he claimed that famous politicians (e.g Bukharin and Trotsky etc) were also responsible alongside the other Bolshevik officials. Therefore, leading to beginning of the purges, to avenge his fellow officials death.",
