# Exam Grading Report

**Total Marks:** 42 / 52

## Summary Comments
The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the period, particularly regarding the transition from War Communism to the NEP and the causes of the Great Purges. Question 1 was answered perfectly. In Question 2, the student provided good detail on the Tambov Rebellion but made a significant chronological error regarding the Kronstadt Mutiny (dating it to 1917). The analysis of source utility in 3(a) was solid, and the comparison of interpretations in 3(b) and 3(c) was excellent. The final essay 3(d) showed good evaluative skills, though some spelling and grammatical errors were present.

### Question 3(a) (6/8 marks)

**Reasoning:** The response reaches Level 3. It provides judgements on utility based on valid criteria (content and provenance). It analyzes the provenance of both sources (Bukharin as a fellow official and Kravchenko as a party official who fled) and uses contextual knowledge (Ryutin Affair) to evaluate the sources.

### Question 3(b) (4/4 marks)

**Citations:**

### Question 3(d) (13/16 marks)

**Reasoning:** The answer reaches Level 4. It provides an explained evaluation reviewing alternative views and comes to a substantiated judgement. It uses precise analysis of the interpretations and selects relevant contextual knowledge (e.g., the scale of arrests, the role of agitprop, and the specific rivals like Bukharin and Trotsky) to support the evaluation. The reasoning is coherent and sustained.
