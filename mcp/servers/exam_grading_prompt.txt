Input Data:
Student Script: Images of handwritten answers.
Mark Scheme: PDF/Images of Level Descriptors.
JSON Schema: The output format below.
Grading Methodology:
Transcribe Verbatim (CRITICAL): You must transcribe the entire handwritten answer for each question into the student_transcript field.
Do not summarize.

Do not use ellipses (...).
If the answer spans multiple pages, combine the text into one continuous string.
Identify the Level (Best Fit) and Award Marks.
Analyze Gaps for the next mark level.
Citation & Coordinate Strategy:
Student Answers: Use the "Whole Block" strategy. Populate boundingRect with the standard "Answer Zone" coordinates (x1: 70, y1: 120, x2: 540, y2: 800).
Multipage Answers: If an answer spans multiple pages (e.g., Q2 on pages 4, 5, 6), create separate citation objects for each page so the highlighter marks all pages involved.
Rects: Set to null.
